This project is a fork of the https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract repository.

## Why another fork?

### The solution has been migrated to .NET 8.0, and ...

* conditional compilation symbols have been removed.
* The code has been cleaned and reformated to automatically adopt the latest syntax sugar. Thus, the project is no
  longer compatible with its upstream source. If you must rely on an already-known upgrade path, stick to the original
  project instead.
* support for Tesseract.Drawing has been removed (might get restored).

### The aim of this fork is...

...having a project that works with the latest .NET Framework version (because .NET 4.8 and .NET Core 3.1 are dowdy).
The dynamic runtime approach (based on DotNetInterop) is excellent but is overhead and adds complexity that IÂ´d like to
eliminate. Besides that, the evolvability and stability of the codebase do not meet my needs yet, so it requires tweaks.

**Improvements to code readability**. There are some low-hanging fruits like:

* Enablement of strict nullability (and addressing all compiler warnings)
* Linearization of code-flow that leads to reduced nesting, for instance,
    * by preferring `using`-declarations instead of `using`-blocks if it does not extend a resource`s lifetime
    * by inverting conditional statements (exit early)
* Inlining of out-variables and moving variable declarations closer to their usage
* Replacement of custom guard clauses with built-in guard clauses
* Substitution of `string.Format` statements by string interpolation
* ...

**Aligning the wrapper API with SOTA architectural concepts as found in the .NET space**, for instance:

* Consistent usage of DI; the goal is to bring hidden dependencies to the surface and turn singleton implementations
  into service configurations with a singleton lifetime behavior (reduces static cling and boosts idempotency).
* Adoption of the module system introduced by .NET Core (improved separation of concerns, reliable abstractions,
  interfaces, and primitive types)
* Changing stateful types into stateless types (some classes need to perform probable erroneous state-checks on objects
  whose type implements the `IDisposable` interface)
* Adoption of performance benchmarks (no more performance measurements in unit tests)
* Evaluation of compilation-time code generators (as a replacement for dynamic code based on reflection emit)
* ...
